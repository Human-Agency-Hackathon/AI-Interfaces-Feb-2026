    "The ha-agent-rpg codebase demonstrates professional-grade architecture with event-driven WebSocket design, comprehensive testing (209 tests), and clean separation of concerns. Key innovation opportunities exist in: (1) Enhanced visual effects and agent animations, (2) Advanced agent collaboration patterns, (3) Performance optimization for large codebases, (4) Rich integration ecosystem, (5) Production monitoring and analytics.",
    "Identified 69 innovation opportunities across 7 dimensions. High-impact quick wins include: bundle splitting (1.53MB→500KB), agent health bars, MCP tool integrations (GitHub, Slack), agent action batching, and file heatmaps. Most ambitious ideas: VR/AR support, distributed agent runtime, reinforcement learning, and multi-model teams.",
    "Created comprehensive innovation roadmap with 69 total ideas prioritized into 4 tiers: Immediate Wins (1-2 weeks), High-Value Features (2-4 weeks), Game-Changers (1-2 months), and Moonshots (3-6 months). Top priority: client bundle splitting for performance, followed by agent health bars and GitHub MCP integration."
