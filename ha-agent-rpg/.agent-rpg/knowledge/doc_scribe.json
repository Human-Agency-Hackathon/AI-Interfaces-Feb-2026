    "Successfully updated root README.md to reflect current Claude Agent SDK architecture. Replaced outdated turn-based system references (TurnManager, turn:start protocol) with accurate descriptions of AgentSessionManager, EventTranslator, MCP tools, and hierarchical navigation. Quick Start now correctly instructs users to set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and use /summon commands instead of obsolete agent.py approach."
