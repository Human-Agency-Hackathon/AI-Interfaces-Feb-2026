The architecture consists of 3 main components:\n\n1. **Bridge Server** (TypeScript/WebSocket): Central hub running on port 3001, managing world state, turn-based logic, agent sessions using Claude Agent SDK, and real-time message broadcasting.\n\n2. **Phaser Client** (Phaser 3/Vite): Browser-based game on port 5173 that renders the JRPG experience with tile maps, agent sprites, dialogue boxes, and visual effects. It's purely a renderer—receives state but never sends actions.\n\n3. **Python Agents**: Sample WebSocket clients that connect to the bridge, register, and take turns executing actions (move, speak, skill, interact, emote, wait, think).\n\nThe system uses a hierarchical map structure where directories become navigable rooms, supports GitHub issue integration as quests, and includes knowledge persistence with findings boards. Test coverage is excellent with 209 passing tests across 14 test files.",

Added #quest-log DOM element and wired it to world:state messages.\n\n4. ✅ **Navigation Doors**: Players can now click on nav_door (yellow triangles) and nav_back (blue triangles) objects to navigate the directory hierarchy. Server tracks player nav state with a navigation stack.\n\n5. ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows added (ci.yml and pr-validation.yml) with server tests, build validation, coverage reporting, PR size checking, and quality gates.\n\nAll 209 server tests passing.
